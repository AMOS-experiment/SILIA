Description: # SILIA - Software Implementation of a Lock-In Amplifier
        
        A software implementation of a multi channel and multi frequency lock-in amplifier to extract periodic features from data
        
        To install, navigate to the package directory in terminal and run 
        ~~~ 
        python setup.py install
        ~~~
        
        For a tutorial on how to use the software, look at the jupyter notebook in the 'Example/' directory. In the notebook, we simulate a dataset but the data inputs can be readings from any device or even old video given that they are formatted the correct way. 
         
        An overview of the lock-in process - see (link to paper) for more info:
