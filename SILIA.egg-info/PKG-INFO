Description: # SILIA - Software Implementation of a Lock-In Amplifier
        
        A software implementation of a multi channel and multi frequency lock-in amplifier to extract periodic features from data
        
        To install, open terminal as admin, navigate to the package directory and run 
        ~~~ 
        python setup.py install
        ~~~
        
        For a tutorial on how to use the software, look at the jupyter notebook in the 'Example/' directory. In the notebook, we simulate a dataset but the data inputs can be readings from any device or even old video given that they are formatted the correct way. 
         
        Below, an overview of the lock-in process. The reference fitting step can also be skipped with a toggle. For more information, see 'Manuscript Draft.pdf' which is an early and rudimentary version of the paper we hope to eventually submit.

        When designing SILIA, we had two principles in mind. The first was that no software can be designed with the foresight to include features for all of its possible use cases without being overwhelmingly complex. And the second was, a user-friendly interface is essential for a software package to be widely accepted. As a result, we focused on writing code that can easily be understood and edited for specific use cases while also ensuring SILIA is easy to use and minimizes data preparation time.
