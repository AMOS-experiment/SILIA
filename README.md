# SILIA - Software Implementation of a Lock-In Amplifier

A software implementation of a multi channel and multi frequency lock-in amplifier to extract periodic features from data


To install, navigate to the package directory in terminal and run 
~~~ 
python setup.py install
~~~

For a tutorial on how to use the software, look at the jupyter notebook in the 'Example/' directory. In the notebook, we simulate a dataset but the data inputs can be readings from any device or even old video given that they are formatted the correct way. 

Please ask Amrut Nadgir (amrut.nadgir@gmail.com) or Richard Thurston (rthurston@lbl.gov) if you have any questions.
